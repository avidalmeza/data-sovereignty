  abstract = {The Alaska Beluga Whale Committe (ABWC) was formed in 1988 to conserve beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) and manage beluga subsistence hunting in western and northern Alaska in cooperation with the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). When the ABWC was formed, there was no consistently funded research or management programme for belugas in Alaska, and co-management was a new concept. The ABWC brought together representatives from beluga hunting communities; federal, state, tribal and local governments; and beluga researchers to develop and implement a programme to manage belugas. With funding from NMFS and others, the ABWC has collected data necessary for informed management decisions including the following: harvest data; aerial surveys of belugas in Bristol Bay and the eastern Bering and Chukchi seas; beluga tracking studies, including training hunters to attach transmitters; a pioneering genetics study of beluga stock identity that has facilitated collection of {$>$}2000 beluga skin samples; and a genetics-based mark--recapture study to estimate beluga abundance in Bristol Bay and validate aerial survey estimates. The ABWC is currently engaged in regional management planning in Kotzebue Sound and the eastern Bering Sea. It produces results that are scientifically valid, locally accepted and cost-effective and is an example of what can be achieved when Native hunters, scientists and managing agencies respect and listen to one another and work together. However, the current NMFS co-management funding process has fundamentally altered the relationship between NMFS and ABWC, with NMFS now acting more like a funding agency than a partner.},

  abstract = {In the current data-driven landscape of wildlife conservation, data sovereignty (i.e. governance and security) is fundamental to determining how knowledge is created and applied to pressing biodiversity concerns. Western science increasingly champions open data, which uplifts data stewardship and sharing to make data more accessible. At the same time, Indigenous Peoples stress the importance of Indigenous data sovereignty (IDS) to assert Indigenous rights over Indigenous data. These two philosophies offer distinct approaches to data sovereignty, creating possible tensions in collaborations between Western scientists and Indigenous Peoples. Awareness of this issue in wildlife conservation is slowly growing, and practical guidance is needed for balancing IDS and open data in collaborations. Here, we review current literature to identify challenges in bringing IDS and open data together in collaborative wildlife conservation. We include specific commentary for wildlife sensors (camera traps and autonomous recording units) due to the growing use and demonstrated interest in open data practices for these technologies and their appeal in Indigenous-led conservation. We describe three nested themes of data sovereignty: collaborative relationships, data governance and data stewardship. Within these themes, we identify nine recommendations to navigate potential IDS and open data tensions in collaborations, stressing the need to focus on relationship building, support Indigenous data governance agendas and to discuss upfront expectations for data stewardship. Additionally, we suggest reflective questions to consider throughout the data life cycle. This provides a framework for understanding the sociocultural implications of wildlife data and supporting IDS throughout the collaborative process, while identifying opportunities to apply open data stewardship practices. Synthesis and applications: Our work demonstrates the need for explicit recognition of IDS principles for wildlife data and proposes general guidance for addressing data sovereignty in collaborative initiatives. We recognize that our recommendations are not exhaustive and that each collaborative context brings unique challenges and opportunities. We invite continued discussion on data governance and stewardship to promote shared learning. Our recommendations can be applied more broadly to facilitate a new approach to data sovereignty in collaborations across the natural sciences.

There are concerns about how narrating climate change in this way can eclipse issues of justice in the energy transition. There are of course different ways of telling time. This essay provides a narration of climate change inspired by particular Indigenous scholars and writers. These conceptions of time narrate time through kinship, not linearity. One implication is that issues of justice are inseparable from the experience of climate change.},
