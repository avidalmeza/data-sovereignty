## {data-menu-title="Since time immemorial…"}

Communities have monitored the Land[^1] (species, ecosystem services, and climate) with observation, since time immemorial [@kukutaiIndigenousDataSovereignty2016]

<br>

These observations (data) are **place-based** and require **protocol** (cultural and scientific) to become knowledge

[^1]: Land as a proper noun; holds the "life and spirit" of all interdependent relations, like plants, water, animals, and humans [@liboironPollutionColonialism2021]

## We gather data to produce knowledge

Data is not knowledge, rather it’s discrete pieces of observation that get chosen, then woven together, filled with meaning, and turned into knowledge

![](images/monitoring.png){.nostretch fig-align="center"}

## But not all data is always gathered…

&nbsp; 1. By whom is the data collected?

&nbsp; 2. Where is the data collected?

&nbsp; 3. How is the data collected?

&nbsp; 4. Where is the data stored after collection?

## What is Indigenous data sovereignty?

> "...An assertion of the rights and interests of Indigenous Peoples in relation to data about them, their territories, and their ways of life"

@carrollCAREPrinciplesIndigenous2020

## But how is it exercised?

**Data for governance**: "…Accurate, relevant, and timely data for policy and decision-making…"

![](images/data_governance.png){fig-align="center"}

[@carrollIndigenousDataGovernance2019]
:::

## But how is it exercised? {.unlisted}

**Governance of data**: "…Mechanisms to honor, protect, and control information internally and externally…" 

![](images/governance_data.png){fig-align="center"}

::: {.right-aligned-text}
[@carrollIndigenousDataGovernance2019]
:::

## Why governance of data?

> “…[Indigenous communities must] rely on outsiders with the requisite resources to obtain this information”

**Academia**
  : Reliant on soft money $\rightarrow$ grants are in short cycles

**Industry**
  : Misaligned incentives $\rightarrow$ interest in bottom line

**U.S. Government**
  : "Domestic dependent nations" $\neq$ tribal sovereignty

## What are the CARE principles?
<br>
  **C** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Collective benefit (equity, development)
<br><br>
  **A** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Authority to control (rights & interests)
<br><br>
  **R** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Responsibility (to worldviews and for capacity)
<br><br>
  **E** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ethics (for justice and future generations)

## What is collective benefit?

Collective benefit restores and maintains the relationships and responsibilities of the community across intergenerational time scales and kinship time (shifts in relationships)

::: {.right-aligned-text}
[@whyteTimeKinship2019]
:::

## What is collective benefit?

- Disaggregate data $\rightarrow$ is it relevant and actionable?
- Code with Indigenous definitions and classifications
- Compensate and attribute knowledge keepers

[@jenningsApplyingCAREPrinciples2023]
:::

## What is collective benefit?

::: {.panel-tabset}
### Disaggregation
Does resolution and sampling match community needs?

- Summary statistics may hide relationships between variables for the most vulnerable
- Large data products can be irrelevant and tedious for nations with less capacity

### Classification

Kichwa ethnoichthyological classification is multidimensional: body size; color; related to animals; related to plants; and related to tools

<br>

When relations are considered, new fish species sub-differentiation insights were gained over the Linnaean species

::: {.right-aligned-text}
[@tobesEthnoichthyologyEthnotaxonomyKichwa2022]
:::

### Attribution

- **During collection**: Ensure proper compensation, authorship, and provenance of knowledge 
- **For communication**: Use relevant citation templates and reference guides [@macleodMorePersonalCommunication2021; @youngingElementsIndigenousStyle2018]
:::
  
## What is authority to control? 

Authority control asserts the rights to harness tribal cultures, values, principles, and mechanisms and apply them to the management and control of the entire data ecosystem 

::: {.right-aligned-text}
[@carrollIndigenousDataGovernance2019]
:::

## What is authority to control? 
  
- Approach consent as dynamic and interactive
- Return outputs to rightsholders in a usable format
- Defer to Indigenous control of data life cycle

::: {.right-aligned-text}
[@jenningsApplyingCAREPrinciples2023]
:::

## What is authority to control? 

Data Management Plans (DMP) need to recognize communities as **rightsholders**, not stakeholders

<br>

DMPs must be co-developed (and re-negotiated) with these communities, collectives and organizations; "no matter how well intentioned, external collaborators cannot impose an IDS agenda on behalf of a partnering community"

::: {.right-aligned-text}
[@tattersallAffirmingIndigenousData2025]
:::

## What is responsibility? 

Responsibility refers to the relationship and investment with community values, worldviews, and innovation

## What is responsibility? 

- Expand opportunities for community capacity
- Respect reciprocity within metadata and labeling
- Affirm community worldviews in data representation

### Capacity building
> "Our cross-cultural partnership approach—called the Sikumiut-SmartICE model—focuses on developing the skills of young Inuit to create the maps, while non-Indigenous partners provide mentorship, tools, and training"

::: {.right-aligned-text}
@beaulieuIndigenousSelfdeterminationCryospheric2023
:::

### Metadata
[**Local Contexts**](https://localcontexts.org/) provide a series of labels and notices that communicate permissions

<br>

The **Maine-eDNA** project has collected samples to better understand human disturbances to coastal macrosystems; partnered with Wabnaki Tribal Nations to add digital markers and labels about the cultural rights and Lands from which the samples were gathered

### Worldview

- [**Llamk’ana**](https://labtecnosocial.org/llamkana-un-lenguaje-de-programacion-en-quechua/) (Quechua) uses patterns of repetition, sequence, and decision from textile making to communicate algorithms
- Jon Corbett on **Cree#**: "...from using computers and programming as tools to generate my artwork to viewing computers as animate creatures, digital representations of my Indigenous heritage..." [@corbettProgrammingCreeAncestral2023]
:::

## What are ethics? 

Ethics refers to the obligations and responsibilities, in conduct and partnerships, that are gained by working with communities
  
## What are ethics? 

- Uphold a community-defined review processes
- Disclose potential financial gain and share benefits
- Consider potential of harm in data protocols

::: {.right-aligned-text}
[@jenningsApplyingCAREPrinciples2023]
:::

## What are ethics?

::: {.panel-tabset}
### All relations are collaborators

- **Seven generations (Haudenosaunee)**: Is the decision obliged to seven generations in the future?

> "Committee members understand the need to have accurate harvest data by stock to sustainably manage the hunt. They also recognize that this information could be ‘used against them’ by anti-whaling or animal protectionist groups…"

### Who's monitoring?

- Asymmetrical distribution of equipment and engagement creates power and bias
- Co-production of monitoring system is a step towards self-determination in management
- Respond to community with judgmental sampling over random sampling

:::

## True sovereignty requires relational obligation in monitoring

> “...The question is not ‘what can I do with this data?’ but ‘to whom am I obliged with this data? What does this data and its data holder owe to community and Land, and how do I best meet those obligations in how this data is stored, shared (or not) and interpreted?’”

<!--Data relationships and practices cannot be simple checkboxes as this can repeat or exacerbate remainders of colonialism-->

## Tools for data sovereignty
- Encryption 
- Time destruction of datasets and keys
- Anonymization
- Access limitations
- Metadata (e.g., provenance documentation)
- Selective reporting (e.g., permissions)
- Use of Indigenous languages
- Review processes (e.g., Tribal regulations)

## Data...
- is discrete information organized into knowledge
- asserts (statistical) identity and self-determination
- wields power as a decision making force
- "...[is] synonymous with life in a modern society..." [@carrollIndigenousDataGovernance2019]
